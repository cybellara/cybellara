Hi, I’m **Cybellara**! 👋

I’m a Computer Science student 💻 with a deep curiosity for how technology intersects with human behavior 🧠. My interests span psychology 🧩, technology ⚙️, and cybersecurity 🔐, and I’m always exploring ways to combine them creatively.
I love building cute, friendly, and interactive web experiences 🌸✨ that make learning and using technology more fun. I’m passionate about experimenting with new tools, frameworks, and ideas to improve my skills 🚀.
I’m still learning 📚 every day and enjoy taking on challenges that push me to grow as a developer and thinker 💡. On this GitHub, you’ll find my projects, experiments, and anything I create along the way.
